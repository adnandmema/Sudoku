# Sudoku
This test took me around 3 hours to solve it and I was totally relaxed and I really enjoyed. 
I didn't use Google or ChatGPT to search for solutions. 
Usually for this kind of well-known problems like Sudoku, Pagination or similar algorithmic problems, I like to find best practices online.
I enjoy solving problems by using my skills and creativity, but I am against reinventing the wheel. If there is a problem that has been around for a while and for that problem are a lot of best practices, design patterns, tested and reviewed, I will take it. This solution was totally created by me just for the sake of test, but on a real world scenario I will definitely have found another better solution for a less time.
I only use it Google on a few cases because I couldn't remember some syntax.
